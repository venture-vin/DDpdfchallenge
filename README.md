#Instructions
Create an app for the DroneDeploy platform. The app should provide a button on the data page that will create a PDF of the map shown. For example:

When the button is clicked it should download a PDF that contains an image of the map being viewed. See http://developer.dronedeploy.com. 

#Challenges
Ran into challenges with using some of the Tiles requests on the plans that are in the examples. Figured out that I needed to upload my own.
